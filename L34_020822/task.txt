Implement previous home task (L31_260722) but with addons

There is should be a button to change a Dark/Light theme. It should change color of the stickers.
When an user clicks on a sticker, a new page is opened
(with a URL like /sticker/id, for example /sticker/1).
On this page user can change the sticker text and save it.
When sticker is saved - the user is redirected to the stickers home page.
