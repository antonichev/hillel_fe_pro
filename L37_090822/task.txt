All components should be used from MUI library

There should be such pages:
/ - home page with a link to Users page
/users - users page that displays all users in a table with Edit and Delete buttons
/user/create - user create page with a form that allows to create a new user
/user/:id - user update page with a form that allows to update existing user

Forms should have Save and Cancel buttons. When they clicked - navigate 
to /users page (Save should save changes also).
